{% mark post -%}

I thought of writing my website using a static site generator and give wordpress a pass.
Why so? Well mostly because it gives me an opportunity to learn some bootstrap and exposure to some frontend development.
Steve losh has outlined some reasons for moving to hyde and the same hold true for me.

-----------------

Tools Needed
--------------------
Vim, Hyde, Bootstrap, Jinja

-------------------
How to get started
--------------------
Hyde unfortunately has a learning curve most of which has to do with the fact that the documentation is not 
very complete at the moment. Here's how you can get started

1. Get hyde and use a starter template to get started, I like bootstrap and I borrowed Jeremy's bootstrap template
You can find it here [Jeremy's Hyde Template](http://github.com/auzigog/hyde-bootstrap)
2. Start reading source code of some sites powered by hyde [Sites](https://github.com/hyde/hyde/wiki/Hyde-Powered)
3. You might need to refer to some jinja documentation [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/)
4. CSS is copied from bootstrap
