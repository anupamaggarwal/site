My experiments with getting started with hyde 
My first post is going to be a genesis story[^1]. I wanted to use github to host a technical blog and saw that [github pages](http://pages.github.com/) officially supports [jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). But let's be honest I'm not going to work on a Ruby project. Enter [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/). See what they did there? Hyde is a static website generator written in Python that supports [Jinja2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) templates. Luckily, I have some familiarity with Jinja from working on the [statsmodels](http://statsmodels.sf.net) documentation that's generated by [Sphinx](http://sphinx.pocoo.org/).

This isn't a how to get started or a migrating from Wordpress or Django post. There [are](http://merlin.rebrovic.net/hyde-starter-kit/index.html) [several](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/01/moving-from-django-to-hyde/) of [those](http://smus.com/wordpress-to-hyde) [already](http://www.coderholic.com/goodbye-wordpress-hello-jekyll/). I'm going to outline some changes I've made to existing Hyde tools to arrive at my workflow for blogging and publishing this site to github pages.

Blogging Workflow
=================

My blog workflow is heavily based on [this one](http://felixleong.com/blog/2012/01/workflow-and-tools-to-maintain-a-hyde-blog-featuring-jenkins).

1. Write pure text post with [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax). Keep it in the top-level drafts/ folder.
2. When ready to publish, copy the file to content/blog/topublish/ and
run ./formatpost.py. Alternatively, I've set a local git alias by
{% syntax bash %}
git config alias.post !./formatpost.py
{% endsyntax %}
so in the top directory, I type 'git post' and it will automatically run
formatpost.py on the first file listdir gives in content/blog/topublish.
Or I can skip the topublish/ step and do
{% syntax bash %}
git post drafts/draft.txt
{% endsyntax %}
I'm asked to fill in a title, a post description, and provide tags
separated by commas.
{% endmark %}
