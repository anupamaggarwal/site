Here are a couple of resouces for learning Haskell 
(which in my humble opinion is the most awesome functional language out there )

[Learn you a Haskell for the great good](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/)
( I am halfway through the book and its well worth the time)

Some folks also suggest 
[Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)

Both of them would cost you exactly 0 dollars so buy a copy today!
