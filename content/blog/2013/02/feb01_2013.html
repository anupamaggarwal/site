{% mark post -%}
Here are a couple of resouces for learning Haskell 
(which in my humble opinion is the most awesome functional language out there )

[Learn you a Haskell for the great good](http://www.learnyouahaskell.com/)
( I am halfway through the book and its well worth the time)

Some folks also suggest 
[Real World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/read/)

Both of them would cost you exactly 0 dollars so buy a copy today!

Here's a quicksort implementation in 5 lines haskell
 {% filter syntax('bash') -%}
quicksort :: (Ord a) => [a]->[a]
quicksort [] = []
quicksort (x:xs) =
        let  less = quicksort [ a | a <-xs , a <=x]
        more = quicksort [ a | a <-xs , a>x]
        in less ++ [x] ++ more 
{%- endfilter %}
