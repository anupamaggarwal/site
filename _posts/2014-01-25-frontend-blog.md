Hello World! from my static jekyll powered website


###Writing a static website


In case you want to write a static website here are some links to get started.
You would have a dozen static templating engines which you can choose from however, the most convenient ones are:-

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)

* [ Hyde ](http://stevelosh.com/blog/2010/01/moving-from-django-to-hyde/#why-static)

Jekyll natively works with github pages so that would work best unless you have your own hosting infrastructure.
In case you are using hyde you can proceed as follows

* Get hyde and use a starter template to get started, If you like bootstrap you can borrow Jeremy's template
   You can find it here [Jeremy's Hyde Template](http://github.com/auzigog/hyde-bootstrap)
* Start reading source code of some sites powered by hyde [sites](https://github.com/hyde/hyde/wiki/Hyde-Powered)
* You might need to refer to some jinja documentation for information on templating [jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/)
